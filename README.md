# World ID Mock App

This is a sample verification app that simulates the behavior of the Worldcoin app to use World ID in the [Test network](https://id.worldcoin.org/test). It works together with World ID's [Javascript Integration](https://id.worldcoin.org/docs/js).

- Generates Sempahore identity for signing World ID requests.
- Persistent Sempahore identities can be generated by signing requests with a real ETH wallet (through WalletConnect interaction).
- Add identity to the tree of verified identities with the identity faucet.
- Interact with World ID's [Javascript Integration](https://id.worldcoin.org/docs/js) to receive verification request, generate ZKP and transfer it back.
